# olive-press
Copies data in an [arf](https://github.com/melizalab/arf) file to new file with no chunking and gzip compression.
Data integrety is checked, then the original file is replaced, if the `--replace` flag is included.

The program `olive-press` improves both the size of data on disk (90% to 70% of original size)  and speed of analysis by removing
"chunking" in the storage of arrays.
